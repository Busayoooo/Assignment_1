        <p>
            Our engineers continuously review maintenance recommendations to optimize the performance, reliability, durability and safety of your Tesla vehicle. Unlike gasoline cars, Tesla vehicles require no traditional oil changes, fuel system maintenance, spark plug replacements or emission checks. Even brake pad replacements are rare because regenerative braking returns energy to the battery, significantly reducing wear on the brakes. Check your owner’s manual for latest maintenance recommendations for your Tesla vehicle.

            <p>Your Tesla vehicle is equipped with an air filter that prevents pollen, industrial fallout, road dust and other particles from entering through the vents. We recommend replacing your cabin air filter every 2 years.</p>

            <h5 class="red-text">Brake Fluid Test</h5>
            <p>We recommend testing your brake fluid for contamination by scheduling a Tesla service appointment every 4 years and replacing as needed Note: Heavy brake usage due to towing, mountain descents or performance driving – especially for vehicles in hot and humid environments – may require more frequent brake fluid checks and replacements.
